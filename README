This code is the simplest test case to reproduce https://github.com/basho/webmachine/issues/82 .

Compile and start the app, then run curl:

curl -v -X DELETE -d "0" -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Connection: keep-alive" http://localhost:8000/ http://localhost:8000/ http://localhost:8000/ http://localhost:8000/ 

You will see most requests produce this:

* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
* Connection #0 seems to be dead!
* Closing connection #0

And some will produce:

* Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
* Connection died, retrying a fresh connect
* Closing connection #0

Or

* Connection died, retrying a fresh connect
* Closing connection #0

In no case will there be an error returned or anything on the app console or in the log.
